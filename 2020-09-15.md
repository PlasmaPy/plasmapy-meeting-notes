## Minutes

* RTD build issues: version conflict for `pygments`; Erik has a fix
* HackMD:
    * Dominik, Erik both fine with migrating to HackMD eventually
* Dask!
    * Xarray runs on Dask already
* Peter's PR
    * https://app.reviewnb.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/895/files/
    * `grid, E, B` -> xarray/plasma class?
    * keep it as it is for now,
* Reaction rates
    * Jacob comes in!
    * Does want to tackle a basic implementation
    * Reaction rate might depend on spins in the two particles!
    * Reaction object:
        * Assuming a Maxwellian, what's your...?
        * given a temperature, what's your cross section?

Example API we came up with:
```python
cross_section("D + T -> He + n", energy=1*u.keV)
reaction_rate_coefficient(“D + T -> He + n”,
                          temperature = 1*u.eV,
                          # distribution - maxwellian by default? Future improvement!
)
# multiply by densities to get reaction rate

# various other reactions than the classic 10-12 fusion ones might be interesting for supernova people!
```
