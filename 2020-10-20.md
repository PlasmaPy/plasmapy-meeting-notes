## Minutes

* Probably not enough time before DPP to do a 0.5.0 release
    * A release in ~2 months would have more substantive changes
* Create a page on website with mission statement related to gathering open source projects for the plasma community in general
    * Two subgroups: affiliated packages and community packages?
    * Community packages would not necessarily be interoperable with PlasmaPy
    * Affiliated packages would be actively working towards interoperability
    * Should look at [Astropy stuff](https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html) which has affiliated, coordinated, and infrastructure packages
    * Can expand it in the future
    * Who should put this on the website?  And when do we want it by?
* Can move source link out of website, and put in footer
* Should put together a PlasmaPy email address
    * Can set this up through register.com: team@plasmapy.org, but requires a monthly fee
    * Nick will look into this, but it may take longer due to bureaucratic stuff for reimbursement
    * [Setting custom domain emails up through google?](https://workspace.google.com/solutions/new-business/)
* Erik will be meeting with Peter biweekly at 9 Pacific on Mondays
* Should add office hours to PlasmaPy google calendar 
* In testing guide, about having multiple assert statements strung together in one test function vs. having a separate test for each assert statement, talk about how a deciding factor is that the former approach could be more appropriate if the outcomes of the subsequent tests would not be helpful in diagnosing problems (i.e. if it doesn't actually make sense to run the subsequent tests).
