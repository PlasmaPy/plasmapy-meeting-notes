## Minutes

* Erik made suggestions that shall be considered harmful
* Python has a [package for goto statements](https://pypi.org/project/goto-statement/)
* Peter's proton radiography
    * Fields & grids
    * Peter Heuer's willing to help with ParticleTracker
    * Next meeting probably on Nov 16
    * Not much is going to happen until 
* Will skip community meeting on Nov 9 because of APS DPP meeting
* Cython vs. Numba
    * Perhaps start with using Numba since it's mostly adding a decorator, and then if we run into any problems, reconsider it
    * Numba probably works on any platform likely to be used...seemingly even a Raspberry Pi
    * Does Numba have a performance profiler?
        * Probably. One of their devs is making progress.
    * Numba is seeing more development than Cython.
    * Numba takes advantage of advances in LLVM and JIT, while Cython 
    * **We will proceed with prototyping/implementing `numba` and only change course if it becomes absolutely apparent to do so.**
    * https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro does use numba - see if they have any difficulties
* Theano - old Python machine learning, hard to debug, like Dask.  pymc3 took over maintenance of theano.  wanted to switch over to tensorflow, but tensorflow also has difficulties. Went with Jax instead - speedups, GPU, take advantage of all the progress in JIT.
    * Moral of this story: numba has the power of current development in JIT behind it, while cython doesn't really get more powerful with the years
* Jean-Luc Picard has a strong claim on being The Cutest of Borg
* [Dominik] Put affiliation on the slides rather on the conference website; also on zenodo
* Presentation prep strategy: put in Gdrive folder using templates that Erik made, for easier collab
    * How does commenting on Gdrive work for .ppt/.pdf?
* US is going through daylight savings, need to update www.plasmapy.org is new UTC time.
* Fit functions PR
    * Mostly done
    * Nick did a fantastic job at code review
    * Need to parametrize tests
    * May need to discuss breaking up tests into smaller units
    * Breaking up tests into smaller units is usually a good thing, but doing this too much can reduce readability. If a test shouldn't be run if a prior test failed, then putting them in logical blocks is fine.  It's a balance.
* `@modify_docstring` — prepend and postpend append lines to docstring.
    * `AbstractFitFunction` subclasses will have parts of the docstring be the same
