### Video Conference Information
* [Zoom video conference link](https://harvard.zoom.us/j/91600794594?pwd=L09iTGtTRUN1RmpsVnNvU05LRnNwQT09)
* Instant messaging: [Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:openastronomy.org) 

## Minutes

* Introductions
* Erik: want to create affiliated packages site on plasmapy as a sort of central hub advertising all the awesome packages relevant to plasma community
    * [Link to form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfz2djEihWkODbkr1ZC5splkX7ZKLAh_Kuy-aXOngTELIm3xQ/viewform)
    * Not license-restricted; Gkeyll for example has a "open access closed development" model, we can accomodate that
* What connections between the different softwares did you think of?
    * Jimmy: let's get Gkeyll to a point where you can call those solvers from PlasmaPy
    * Nick: common initial/boundary conditions for simulations
    * Andrew: translating between different data formats
    * Gyrokinetics vs MHD: significantly different formats
* types of standards
    * imas
    * openPMD
    * [too many competing ones](https://xkcd.com/927/)
* OMFIT: formulary, Langmuir probe functionality: could be ported over to PlasmaPy?
* Education for open source software
    * Software Carpentry
    * [Princeton has/had *various people :)* teaching software development practices for scientific computing](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/events/apc-524-mae-506-ast-506-software-engineering-scientific-computing)
* Sterling suggested the possibility of a Hack week at DPP
    * similar to Astro Week (http://astrohackweek.org/2020/) that would take part of DPP
    * NRL interns would be interested in joining (Paul Adamson)
    * possibly more like a summer school
    * maybe do something with the PlasmaPy Workshop funding
* **create a community channel on PlasmaPy's element so we can keep the convo open**
