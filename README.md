# The PlasmaPy Project

This repository is intended for project wide documents and discussions.
Repository specific items and development (e.g. bug reporting) should be posted
to their respective repository.  Issues and discussions brought up in this repository
should be on overarching topics related to the management and planning of the 
PlasmaPy project (e.g. policies, project road mapping, workshop planning, etc.).

## Communication

If you have an idea to contribute to the PlasmaPy project (that is not better suited
for one of our [related repositories](#related-repositories)), then there are several 
ways to communicate with the PlasmaPy team.

1. [The PlasmaPy chat room.](https://app.element.io/#/room/#plasmapy:openastronomy.org)
   
   All members of the PlasmaPy team are active in our chat room, so this is the best
   place to post a "simple" question and get a quick response.

1. [The `plasmapy-project` discussion page.](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy-project/discussions)
   
   The discussion page is a good place to post a question or idea that is too detailed
   for a chat thread, but does not reach the bar of an issue.  A post on our discussion
   page creates an open threaded post that allows for a back-and-forth conversation with
   the PlasmaPy team and community.

1. Create of responds to an [issue](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy-project/issues).

   Issues are more formal than a conversation opened in the discussion forum.  They are
   intended more to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs associated with the
   project.
