3. Ben

## Action Items

1. [Erik] do another review of PR 932
2. [Erik] update and push changes to notebook associated w/ PR 932
3. [Ramiz & Erik] will think new name for `two_fluid_dispersion_soluntion()` in PR 932 (possibly `two_fluid_bellan_solution()`).
4. [Ramiz] will create `plasmapy/dispersion/analytical/` in followup PR to PR 932
5. [Ramiz] will open an Issue outlining the two fluid analytical solutions he's woring on for PR 932 and the followup PRs

## Minutes

* sub-pkg structure
    ```bash
    plasmapy
    +-- dispersion
    |   +-- analytical/  # for solutions
    |   +-- numerical/  # for solvers
    |   +-- __init__.py
    |   +-- core.py
    ```
* possible solvers
    * fluid solvers from xenon: https://github.com/liangwang0734/xenon/blob/master/fluid/fluid_dr.py
    * could use these as a basis for our solver...would need to properly cite
* [Erik] will make changes to jupyter notebook and push it for PR #932
* Ramiz has currently identified 5 analystical expression (3 from bellan2012)
    * Ramiz has several expessions being coded in other branch and awaiting PR 932 to be complete before opening separate PRs
    * all expressions come from a two fluid solutions
    * idea is for each branch to have their own functions and then have a factory function `two_fluid_solution()` that could call the requested branch
    * possible model
        ```python
        def two_fluid_solution(branch="ballan"):
            """This is a factory function."""
            _solns = {
                "bellan": two_fluid_bellan,
                "hasegawa": two_fluid_hasegawa,
            }
            _soln = _solns[banch]

            ...

        def two_fluid_bellan():
            ...

        def two_fluid_hasegawa()
            ...
        ```
    * The current expression in PR 932 is named `two_fluid_dispersion_solution()` and should be given a more explicit name to distguish it from the other solutions...possibly `two_fluid_bellan_solution()` since bellan2012 is credited with the solution
    * `two_fluid_hasegawa()` might not be given the *hasegawa* name since that author is not directly credited with the soln...instead have a name more repsentive of the branch or assumptions
* each analytical expression will have its own notebook
* WE SHOULD ADD EASTER EGGS
