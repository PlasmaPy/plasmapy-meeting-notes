## Attendees

1. Erik
2. Steve

## Action Items

**copy action items from last week**

***Erik***
* Open PR to update fit_function Linear.root_solve that handles `m = 0` and `b = 0` cases
* Finish writing tests for `find_floating_potential()`
* Add to list of functionality the ability to find `Te` from fitting to the left side of the dI/dV peak.

***Gurleen***
* Implement a prominence "uncertainty" for `vp` inf `find_plasma_potential_didv()`.
    * for "uncertainty" will use FWHM of the peak
    * also report the prominence of the peak

***Future***
* open an issue to construct a metric that considers the signal noise when reporting the peaks "prominence" (`find_plasma_potential_didv()`)

## Minutes

* lots of pie was consumed over the last week
* getting Te from fitting to the left-side if dI/dV vs. V was brought up again
    * This has seen recent success on fitting curves associated with LaPD's cathode upgrade
    * knappmiller2006 - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.73.066402
    * fitted parameter from this approach could be used to approximate `n_e` (assuming gaussian)
* Priority of functionality:
    1. floating potential
    1. ion-saturation
    1. plasma potential via dI/dV
    1. Te from left side of dI/dV
    2. Te from linear of log(I) vs. V
    3. plasma potential from two linear intersection (i.e. electron exponential and electron saturation)
    4. ...
