## Attendees

1. Steve
2. Erik
3. Gurleen

## Action Items

**copy action items from last week**

***Erik***
* Open PR to update fit_function Linear.root_solve that handles `m = 0` and `b = 0` cases
* Finish writing tests for `find_floating_potential()`
* Add to list of functionality the ability to find `Te` from fitting to the left side of the dI/dV peak.

***Gurleen***
* Implement a prominence "uncertainty" for `vp` inf `find_plasma_potential_didv()`.
    * for "uncertainty" will use FWHM of the peak
    * also report the prominence of the peak

***Future***
* open an issue to construct a metric that considers the signal noise when reporting the peaks "prominence" (`find_plasma_potential_didv()`)

6. Pull requests in progress 
    1. [PR #889](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/889): calculating floating potential
    2. [PR #897](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/897): plasma potential via dI/dV
    3. [PR #813](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/813): Langmuir & Diagnostic Framework

## Minutes

* Gurleen started incorporating an uncertainty for `find_plasma_potential_didv()`
    * fit a Gaussian + zero offset to the peak
    * the Gaussian defines the peak and reporting the "uncertainty" as FWHM
* approach for `find_plasma_portential_didv()`
    1. find peak using `scipy.signal.find_peaks()` and report "uncertainty" as FWHM (default, or user can request a prominence)
    2. merge above functionality
    3. in followup PR add fits for Gaussian, Cauchy, and two exponential+linear
    4. in followup PR that calcs Te using the left side exponential+linear fit
        * should be a separate function that is called by `didv`
        * should not duplicate calculations
        * should be a requested calculation done by `didv`
* **Next meeting tentatively the Jan. 11th, 2021**
