## Attendees

* Dominik
* Nick
* Erik
* Ehab
* Tiger

## Action Items

***Dominik***
- [x] link back to discourse from github discussion pages
    - do we want to do that?
- [x] do the big migration of meeting notes repo etc etc, with separate meeting directories
    * this has been done and this is a little test change to see how badly I broke the links
- [ ] update Discourse links to GitHub Discussions (website, RTD, and repo links, README!)

***Erik***
- [ ] need to start summarizing the roadmap from past meetings, this will facilitate future discussions
- [x] form core Review team of Erik, Nick, and Dominik
- [ ] Review [PR 932](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/932) Dispersion

***Nick***
- [x] After Erik creates Reviewer Team, assign team to PR 942 as a test run for the process
- [ ] Create an issue on adding a Jupyter notebook on Coulomb logarithm super magical fun stuff
- [ ] Review [PR 962](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/962) give üëç or üëé on naming scheme
- [ ] ~~Think about creating an issue for which default Coulomb logarithm to use~~

## Minutes

* **MEETINGS WILL RETURN ON JAN. 5TH 2021**
* Need to review development guide on whether instructions for pre-commit usage are there
    * Need to get Erik to read them!
* Going with GitHub discussions for now
    * GitHub discussion have the benefit of visibility, better interop with issues/PR...but will likely have slow development and less features than Discourse
    * update discussion forum links
    * post on discourse that we'll be trying github discussions out
* https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/305
* sphinx:
    * single ticks `` ` ``: default to `py:mod:` in sphinx (which is utilized by intersphinx referencing)  e.g. `` `numpy.nan` `` maps to `` py:mod:`numpy.nan` ``
    * double ticks ` `` `: code blobs, ``a = np.isnan(b)``
    * math blocks: ``:math:`a = nan(b)` ``
    * PlasmaPy's usage of the above goes like
        * single ticks when trying to link/reference code objects/members (this creates links to said objects documentation)
        * double ticks when writing inline code that does not reference a documented code object
        * math syntax when talking about math objects
