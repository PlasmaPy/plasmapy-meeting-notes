***Dominik***

* **will release v0.5.0 by December 9th (& will record the process to post to YouTube)**
* Add a manual GitHub Action that builds and deploys PlasmaPy.org

## Minutes

* **ROADMAP**
    * no one has brain power for this today
* plasmapy.github.io still uses travis 
* GitHub discussions are out now!
* website [PR #80](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy.github.io/pull/80): Affiliated Packages
    * ready to merge based on Approved review
    * each new Affiliated Package will get their own PR so the submitter can review the entry
* [Dominik] is going to ignore ionization state PR for now and release PlasmaPy 0.5.0 tomorrow, so we don't delay the newsletter for it; PR review comes right after
* [PR 909](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/909) was simplified to just Grids (no longer includes Fields)
    * **now now doctor, now is not the time for fields. that comes later**
    * `xarray` implementation?
* Is `z_mean` a `Particle` attribute or a `Plasma`/`ParticleCollection` attribute?
    * [Dominik] agrees `z_mean` belongs more to `Plasma`, not `Particle`
* [PR #957](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/957): Patch for `Alfven_speed` & `mass_density`
    * good to merge based on review approval
* `black` results sometimes give different results based on pre-commit and local executions, this is because the pre-commit `black` version is fixed at `19.10b0` and local builds usually use the latest version
    * Which version should we use?
    * [Erik] I don't care which version, I'm just noting that the different versions is what is causing the different results
* For PlasmaPy.org repo, it would be nice to have a manual GitHub Action that will build & deploy the website
