> 
> ***Nick***
> - [x] After Erik creates Reviewer Team, assign team to PR 942 as a test run for the process
> - [ ] Create an issue on adding a Jupyter notebook on Coulomb logarithm super magical fun stuff
> - [ ] Review [PR 962](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/962) give 👍 or 👎 on naming scheme
> - [ ] ~~Think about creating an issue for which default Coulomb logarithm to use~~

***Erik***

* Review [PR 962](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/953)

## Minutes

* [VlaPy](https://github.com/joglekara/VlaPy)
    * looking to incorporate functionality from `plasmapy`
    * collision frequencies...most interested in
    * Archis should open a GitHub discussion so we can converse about interoperabilities
    * [JOSS review of VlaPy](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/2133) (back from May)
    * Dashboard at https://alpha-continuum.ergodic.io/ to run simulations from ("simulation-as-a-service")
* immediate "action items":
    * start doing research with vlapy ;)
    * funding - CSSI tends to prefer universities over small companies;
* `VlaPy` has an [electrostaic dispersion solver](https://github.com/joglekara/VlaPy/blob/master/vlapy/diagnostics/z_function.py)
