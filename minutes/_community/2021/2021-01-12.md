* Open issues on...
    1. Which Coulomb lagarithms should we support and how do we advertise them?
    2. Notebook on Coulomb logarithm

## Minutes

* Dominik merged Grids2 too early, Erik being the primary reviewer still had stuff to do there.
    * sorry!
* project idea: Distribution functions
    * instead, maybe use [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html)
        * alternative: [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
* NEI #41 https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-NEI/pull/41
* [PR 962](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/962): Coulomb logarithm naming
    * close to being merged
    * spawning 2 more issues
        * which Coulomb logarithms should we support?
        * Notebook on Coulomb logarithm
* Stuart, on rebases:
    > It's very easy to get carried away with rebases and squashes etc. I am personally of the opinion that it's a tool that's very useful sometimes but rarely needs to be wielded, especially by those who are not sufficiently trained in the art, given there are often substantially simpler and less risky alternatives.
* Further CI reworks
    * GitHub Actions works nicely.  Cleaner, easier to parse errors than Azure, CircleCI.
    * Ideal: move CircleCI stuff to GitHub Actions.  Would let people only need to learn GitHub Actions rather than multiple CI systems.  Only really special thing from CircleCI was Giles which would provide links to view doc builds.  Giles also does change logs, but we can probably do that from GitHub Actions
    * Top-level directory would get less cluttered if we only have one CI
    * General agreement that it would be great to have only one CI, and that we should try moving to GitHub Actions.
    * There are CI tools for notebooks, e.g. that run `black` on them; checks outputs.  Thinking about something that raises an exception that, e.g., "you committed a notebook without cleaning output", but you can have a label that the notebook should have its output
