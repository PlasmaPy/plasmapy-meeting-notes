***Erik***
* add OMFIT to affiliated pkgs
* finish tests for [PR 889](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/889)
* Review Test 2 [PR 920](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/920)
* will merge [PR 932](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/932) tonight (1/19)
* take back up [PR 951](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/951): Update quantum.py ... seem to have stalled because of me

***Dominik***
* Write tests for [PR 979](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/979) - "Relativistic Boris Pusher"
* open PR to drop py36

***Nick***
* will merge [PR 962](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/962) - "Coulomb logarithm naming"
* will assign himself to [PR 978](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/978) - "nuclear cross-sections & rates"

## Minutes

* Dispersion relation work
    * PR close to merging
    * next pr: renaming
        * there are ~3 analytical solutions that are branches/roots of equation
        * Bellan (woo, I read 1/3 of his textbook once!) figured out a way to get a general non-branchy solution
    * really cool notebook that reproduces Bellan's figures!
* roadmap Transport...will try to get initial API in place by June 2021
* [PR 979](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/979): Relativistic Boris Pusher
    * add without test with major warning or write tests now
    * question arises b.c. old PR on `ParticleTracker` adds tests and that might be needed to be merged first
    * **Will write tests.**
* When testing code, we should always consider testing on examples from published works.
* Coulomb log:
    * mostly done
    * mergeable once Tiger finishes final changes?
* plasmapy-nei#42
    * Nick is also wanting to get doc tests up through GitHub actions for [xrtpy](https://github.com/HinodeXRT/xrtpy)
    * https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-NEI/pull/42
* Update README [PR 977](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/977)
    * restore codecov
    * add badge the links to affiliated pkgs
        * badge format info can be found at https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy.github.io/pull/80#issuecomment-728212513
* agreed to drop support of py36 like it's the Curiosity rover
* old off on [PR 961](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/961) - "Update development guide" ...needs more development and time to do it
