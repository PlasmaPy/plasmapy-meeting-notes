* Pawel

## Action Items

***Erik***
> ***Continuation***
> * Open "Project Issue" on the distribution functions
> * refine roadmap for next weeks discussion
> * add OMFIT to affiliated pkgs
> * take back up [PR 951](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/951): Update quantum.py ... seem to have stalled because of me
> * Open Draft PR about `particle_like` & `particle_input` update

***Dominik***
> ***Continuation***

> * Write tests, check formula for [PR 979](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/979) - "Relativistic Boris Pusher"
>    * started on this
* Final review on [PR 981](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/981): Grids 3
* PR on `plasmapy.plasma.geometry` for [exact Solov'ev equlibrium with an arbitrary boundary](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04449.pdf)
    
***Nick***
> ***Continuation***
> * Open issues on...
>     1. Which Coulomb lagarithms should we support and how do we advertise them?
>     2. Notebook on Coulomb logarithm
> * add feedback to roadmap items "Workshop" and "Simulations"
> * will assign himself to [PR 978](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/978) - "nuclear cross-sections & rates"

***Pawel***
* Outline functionality from `fiducial` to contribute to `plasmapy` and state on issue [990](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/issues/990)

## Minutes

* Peter: attended a 130-people charged particle radiography workshop
    * breakout rooms
    * lack of community code for this area
    * survey counting starter codes; "at least dozens" doing the exact same thing
    * need to standardize
    * enthusiastic buy-in expected!
    * we have a list of 5-6 people from community code breakout room; Peter will send them email once we release
    * everyone agreed that PlasmaPy was awesome :joy_cat: 
    * organizer was Derek Schaffer, who can also disseminate info
    * next workshop in 2-3 years
    * after-hours introduction to contributing to open source package at APS?
    * our (well, mostly Peter's) module accepts multiple particles; should probably rename it
    * How open would attendees be to forming a working group?
        * Maybe get some functionality in first, then invite people later
    * Would be helpful to post the YouTube video of Nick's DPP poster on how to contribute to open source projects like PlasmaPy
* Should be ready to go and needs a final review [PR 981](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/981): Grids 3
* Pawe≈Ç: [FIDUCIA (#990)](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/issues/990)
    * routines for DANTE filtered diode array
    * 18 different diodes
    * collects X-rays
    * recover spectrum from diodes
    * uses cubic splines
    * SANDIA has proprietary internal code to do that
    * gamma detector: FIDUCIA could be adapted to that
    * generally everyone's down to contribute the mechanical parts into PlasmaPy and have FIDUCIA be more of a DANTE-specific interface 
    * Licensing:
        * put license for FIDUCIA in PlasmaPy?
        * quote FIDUCIA paper + Zenodo code repo from PlasmaPy
* how does this all tie back into analysis/diagnostics 
* Code review intent tags: select keywords like [optional], [alternative], [desired]
    * Nick saw a lot of Erik's comments as "required", while Erik was making off-hand comments
    * maybe too mechanical?
    * don't want to have people consult guides on How To Parse PlasmaPy's Reviews Of My Pull Requests
    * we can test out different tags over the next month to see how it works
    * could also have a specific one-liner at the top of a review comment
* For `plasmapy` team member, leave merging for the contributor after a review approval
* Have a `plasmapy.plasmapy.geometry` to contain equilibrium functionality for specific device gemoetries (tokamaks, spheromaks, stellarators, etc.)
    * [exact Solov'ev equlibrium with an arbitrary boundary](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04449.pdf)
* Recommended book: [Silia - error propagation in bayesian statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Analysis-Bayesian-Devinderjit-Sivia/dp/0198568320)
