> * refine roadmap for next weeks discussion
> * add OMFIT to affiliated pkgs
> * take back up [PR 951](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/951): Update quantum.py ... seem to have stalled because of me
* When `plasmapy.formulary.paschen` is created [PR 1000], I will add the documentation side of things
* When [PR 985](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/985) is merged I will create the PR for updating `@particle_input`

***Dominik***
> ***Continuation***
> * add feedback to roadmap items "Transport" and "Particle Tracker"

* Investigate GitHub Actions new contributor bot for automatically adding comments for new contributors adding a PR (or the like).
    * message to users that checks don't need to pass right away (we'll work together to get things refined)
    * how to run pre-commit `isort` and `black`

***Nick***
> ***Continuation***
> * Open issues on...
>     1. Which Coulomb lagarithms should we support and how do we advertise them?
>     2. Notebook on Coulomb logarithm
> * add feedback to roadmap items "Workshop" and "Simulations"
> * will assign himself to [PR 978](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/978) - "nuclear cross-sections & rates"
* put some effort towards the dev guide

***Pawel***
> ***Continuation***
> * Outline functionality from `fiducial` to contribute to `plasmapy` and state on issue [990](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/issues/990)

## Minutes

* Need to make sure we update dev guide before hack week
* Paschen Curve
    * put functionality in `/plasmapy/formulary/paschen.py`
    * I [Erik] will add the documentation side and push it to the branch
* Future low temperature plasma functionality (where to put it?)
    * Field emission 
    * Next steps
        * move file into the formulary
        * Erik will push documentation stuff into the branch
* Need to put how-to info for documentation into the dev guide
* GitHub Actions has a bot that can post the first time someone makes a pull request, and have a welcome statement, plus some helpful information
    * https://youtu.be/gPW6b-EHSEA
    * [Dominik] got `self.volunteered` into implementing this
    * Make a statement the checks don't have to pass right away
* particle_like:
    * Once [PR 985](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/985) is merged I [Erik] will update branch about `@particle_input` and open a draft PR
* Plasma hack week
    * scheduling in progress
    * tutorials before projects
    * thinking 4 hrs/day for 5 days
    * should record and post to YouTube (dependent on presenter and attendee approval)
    * Paul Adamson, NRL  (also Sterling Smith @ GA)
        * huge expertise with existing hackathons
        * ask him for input
* pull request message currently implies things need to pass on submission
* discussion about pre-commit 
    * possible tool that could run `black` & `isort` when the pull request is merged
* associate Paschen data with particle class! another huge automated json rewrite on the way, then!
