## Action Items

***Erik***
> ***Continuation***
> * Open "Project Issue" on the distribution functions
> * refine roadmap for next weeks discussion
> * add OMFIT to affiliated pkgs
* Review [PR 951](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/951): Update quantum.py ... seem to have stalled because of me
* When `plasmapy.formulary.paschen` is created [PR 1000], I will add the documentation side of things
* When [PR 985](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/985) is merged I will create the PR for updating `@particle_input`
    * I need to review PR 985

***Dominik***
> ***Continuation***
> * add feedback to roadmap items "Transport" and "Particle Tracker"
> * Write tests, check formula for [PR 979](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/979) - "Relativistic Boris Pusher"
>    * started on this
> * PR on `plasmapy.plasma.geometry` for [exact Solov'ev equlibrium with an arbitrary boundary](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04449.pdf)
* Investigate GitHub Actions new contributor bot for automatically adding comments for new contributors adding a PR (or the like).
    * message to users that checks don't need to pass right away (we'll work together to get things refined)
    * how to run pre-commit `isort` and `black`
* When do we need to submit to OpenAstronomy about GSOC?
* Dominik will be taking lead on GSOC org/planning activities

***Nick***
> ***Continuation***
> * Open issues on...
>     1. Which Coulomb lagarithms should we support and how do we advertise them?
>     2. Notebook on Coulomb logarithm
> * add feedback to roadmap items "Workshop" and "Simulations"
> * will assign himself to [PR 978](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/978) - "nuclear cross-sections & rates"
* put some effort towards the dev guide

## Minutes

* Google Summer of Code (GSOC)
    * **Do we want to participate?**
    * Take on one or two students for about a 10 wk project
    * Google pays them, we donate our time
    * mostly undergrad
    * https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline
    * GSOC organization application deadline Feb. 19, 2021 at 11:00 AM PST
    * we'd probably work under OpenAstronomy
        * https://openastronomy.org/gsoc/suborg_guidelines.html
    * **We do we need to submit to OpenAstronomy?**
    * Dominik will take lead on pushing this through
* Auto-merge
    * people like it
    * [Erik] will enable it for `plasmapy` (assuming authors get to decide to use it or not)
* pre-commit automatic style linter
    * trying it out on on `plasmapy-nei`
    * it would be nice to by able to apply the action optionally
* https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/issues/1011 Peter's parallel Particle-pickling problems (Python! :snake:)
    * tests now in `plasmapy/particles/tests/test_pickling.py`
