7. Meeting time after US time change
8. How to cite?
    * If functionality is based off of someone someone else's work, how do we communicate citation?
    * Thoughts on a `__citation__` dunder for appropriate functionality? Could be done with a decorator. Could be formatted in `bibtex`

## Minutes

* `ParticleInput` decorator
    * rip out QuantityInput from astropy, then rework for particles?
* Renaming of `IonicFraction`, `IonizationState`, and `IonizationStateCollection`
    * [#1053](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/issues/1053)
    * naming scheme is a little ambiguous
    * Currently works like...
        ```python
        >>> IonizationStateCollection(["H", "C", "W"])
        >>> IonizationState([C, C+, C++, C+++]) (isotope?)
        >>> IonicFraction: C+, n, T_e, T_i
        ```
    * Could `IonicFraction` be made private?
        * would relax naming **??**
        * But we allow iterating over `IonizationState` which yields `IonicFraction`
        * Since it's uses might be public, making it private is probably not the way to go.
    * Possible alternate naming schemes
        * `IsotopeCollection`
            * `IsotopeSomething`
                * `ChargeStates`
                * `ChargeLevels`
        * `SpeciesIonizationState`. `SpeciesChargeState`, `IonizationStateSingleSpecies`
        * `MultipleSpeciesIonizationState`, `MultipleSpeciesChargeState`, `IonizationStateMultipleSpecies`
    * Abundance in astro = how often do you find element compared to another (e.g. iron compared to hydrogen)
    * Peeters_2000:
        > In this paper the indices have the following meaning. A **species** is denoted by a Latin subscript, whereas a Greek subscript denotes a particular **charge state** of a species. This notation is convenient because we will average over the **charge states** in Sec. IV to obtain a set of equations that depend only on the species indices. All charge states of one species are assumed to have the same flux surface averaged temperature. flux surface can, however, be different for the different charge states. 
    * What is the true name of `IonizationStateCollection` in the language of the making, the language the dragons speak?
    * **The Current Naming Scheme**
        * `IonicFraction` -> `IonicLevel` 
        * ~~`IonizationState` -> `SpeciesIonizationState`~~ (not yet)
        * ~~`IonizationStateCollection` -> `MultipleSpeciesIonizationState`~~
    * Maybe later we can refactor `IonicLevel` to be related to a new `Species` class
    * https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/discussions/1020
    * in terms of building blocks: current `IonicFraction` is the quantum of functionality; we then have a collection of quanta and a collection of collections on top of that
* The moral of today's meeting: *state can mean different things!*
* changelog fixes
    * [Changelog 0.6.0](https://plasmapy--1052.org.readthedocs.build/en/1052/whatsnew/0.6.0.html)
    * [Stuart's comment on tagging](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/1052#discussion_r585472920)
    * TODO rename grids note from PR 1027 to non-breaking (grids weren't in 0.5); same
