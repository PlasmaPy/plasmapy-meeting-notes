## Minutes

* Trade-off analysis on pros and cons of tradeoff analyses
    * (thanks, my connection is iffy)
    * **Take away: Whenever a development item comes up that needs further discussion of implementation, pros and cons, etc. then we open an issue to have a public discussion of it.**
* Test helpers
    * Trade-off analysis!
    * @StanczakDominik volunteers to refactor particles tests without run_test in the next 2 weeks as a prototype for our trade off analysis
    * also look, you can tag people on hackmd like this now
    * people generally like the option of checking if a specific exception and not its sublass is raised; `pytest.raises` does not do that, @StanczakDominik volunteers to investigate

* **Starting practice of Triaging open PRs during the 1st meeting of every month.**
* **Have a "journal club" discussion about unfamiliar coding practices/pkgs/etc. at the last meeting of every month.**
    * @StanczakDominik volunteers
