## Attendees

* Erik (welcome back!)
* Nick
* Dominik
* Peter

## Action Items

***Everyone***
* practice pronunciation of Braginskii for next week
    * ðŸ™€

## Minutes

* Erik's `automodapi` version
    * Documentation still being written
    * Could merge with cursory review; not as much scrutiny necessary as for main package right now.
        * Dominik still wants to review in a few months, once there's time to finally learn sphinx 
    * list of functions on main formulary page isn't getting sorted right now; Erik has an idea why
* Proton meeting expands to Diagnostics meeting
    * No more Proton Mondays
* Philosophical question on ClassicalTransport
    * Current implementation in class system
    * method A might not depend on var x
    * Epperlein-Haines mostly 
    * Class structure (with optional arguments; raises if insufficient information) nice for `CachedProperties`
    * `functools.lru_cache/memoize`
    * Normalizations - Nick has an implmentation of them in plasmapy.simulation; could be helpful for transport as well
    * Formulary stuff could accept plasma objects (via decorator transforming plasma instance into inputs?)
    * optimize this kind of stuff for usability; optimize lite functions approach for speed
    * lots of overlap between a from_plasma decorator and proposed from_particle
* Normalization class is pretty much a translator class
    * 
    

```python=
normalization = MHDNormalization(B=39703*u.T, n=9873*u.m**-3)
dimensionless_particle = dimensional_particle / normalization
dimensional_particle = normalization * dimensionless_particle

# can you imagine doing this?
set_of_parameters = dict(B=5.2*u.T, n_e = 1e20*u.m**-3) # some container
normalized_parameters = normalization.to_dimensionless(set_of_parameters)
renormalized_parameters = normalization.to_physical(normalized_parameters)

assert set_of_parameters == renormalized_heh_parameters
```


dimensionless = dimensional / normalization

E = Eâ‚€ * E~
