## Minutes

* Erik's refactoring automodapi (need found through lite functions)
* lite functions will go into 2 parts:
    * decorator/usage first
    * docs later
* integrate CSS/templates into the automodapi package?
* neoclassics: found bugs in formulas; pretty devastated atm
* hypothesis has nasty intermittent bug; Dominik has fix planned
* Paschen
    * user excitement!
    * Nick will meet with Christoph to collaborate
    * how to store data?
        * https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/1000#issuecomment-788412701
        * similar example, aurora: https://aurora-fusion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#ionization-equilibrium
        * if gas/electrode pair in our database, pull it from it; otherwise, just take quantities
    * 3 parameters; would be nice to have a 3-way (from 2 inputs, calculate 3rd output) function of sorts
        * that's definitely a follow-up, though
    * Should double check the units of the Paschen constants (probably dimensionless)
    * Add a table of constants that we have in the docs, and have it include sources of the data!
* Hack week:
    * paragraph for website in the works
    * gitpod might be better than binder; need to see how resilient it is to losing connection
    * testing session 45-60; Dominik needs to figure out an estimate
