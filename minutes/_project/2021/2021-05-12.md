* We need to start reaching out to existing open-source pkgs to ask them to be listed on the Community Packges page
* No progress on the PlasmaPy Newsletter
* Delaware student
    * just Ramiz for now, but he his writting is dissertation
    * if Ramiz stays after graduating, then he'd stay apart of the PlasmaPy project
    * if Ramiz leaves, then there's a potential new grad student (Eliot)
    * In either case would likely get Eliot up to speed (probably durring the summer)
    * Dispersion solver would still be the primary project
