The "Project" meetings (formerly known as CSSI meetings) focus on PlasmaPy project
management issues.  Topics include, but  are not restricted to: community outreach,
website management, YouTube storyboarding, educational planning, workshop organization,
etc.  Code specific topics are discussed in the public 
[community meetings](https://www.plasmapy.org/meetings/weekly/) and 
["office" hours](https://www.plasmapy.org/meetings/office_hours/).

If you have questions/comments about project management issues, then please reach out
