## Action Items

***Erik***
* choosing a metadata scheme...can we adopt [prdformat](https://github.com/phyzicist/pradformat/tree/main/Python) or is it too young

## Minutes

* **PR 1123**: Path integrated diagnostics
    * path vs. line integrated...path is the ABS class and 
        * path is the ABC class...setup for diagnostic and is agnostic of path
        * line integrated = special cause a linear path
        * proton is now a subclass of "path integrated" and the path is generated with the particle pusher
    * at 95% completion
* **PR 1134** saving radiographs
    * saving results before generating figures
    * no long pickling...this was causing issues when ever the parent class is changed and then used to un-pickle old data
    * dropping `xarray` (because of pickling) and saving data in `npz` files instead
    * could also save using HDF5...benefit of this is that the data stays on disk until directly called
    * Community format [PRadformat](https://scott.cikeys.com/prad/overview/), github repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/phyzicist/pradformat/tree/main/Python). Peter suggests we could implement this format without directly importing the module.
* Thomson scattering
    * PR 1105 is in review now
    * lite-function scheme hashed out...needs writing of documentation and review
