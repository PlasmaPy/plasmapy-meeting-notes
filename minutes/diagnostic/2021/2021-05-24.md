## Action Items

***Erik***
* look into @cache thermal_speed_coefficients
* Need to review PR 1134
    * think of new name for `SyntheticRadiographParticleTracer`
* review PR 1123

## Minutes

* **PR 1145**: Lite functions
    * Lite-Function are split into two PRs 1145 and a yet to be opened PR
    * 1145 forcuses on just implmentation/framwork of lite-functions
    * [Yet to be opened PR] forcuses on documentaiton of lite-functions
    * these two PRs replace PR 1098
    * PRs that lead to 1145 inclued PR 1105 and 1144
    * Last thing to do on 1145 are writting tests
    * Look to @cache thermal_speed_coefficents and privatize it so it does not appear in the API
    * also have `thermal_speed_lite` directly call `thermal_speed_coefficients`
* 1134 and 1123 are ready for final review and merge
* 1134
    * still needs to refactor a few names to clarify purpose of functionality
        * `SyntheticProtonRadiograph` -> Class that contains particle tracer
            * want to rename to `SyntheticRadiographParticleTracer`?
            * Or `proton_radiography.ParticleTracer`
            * `CPRParticleTracer`
            * want to get Proton out of the name since it will be for any charged particle
        * `synthetic_radiograph()` -> Function that makes histogram
            * Keep name?
            * this used to be a method on SyntheticProtonRadiograph and was brokenout into its own function
* generalize package naming
    * enforse shortname by using it docuemntation `charged_particle_radiography -> cpr`
    * if that's the case could just name `SyntheticRadiographParticleTracer` as `Tracker`

``` bash
plasmapy.diagnostics
+-- proton_radiography (charged_particle_radiography)
```

```python
import plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography as cpr
# then
sim = cpr.Tracker(...)
```

* path integrated diagnostics 1123
* Next functions for Lite-Functions
    * `plasma_frequency`
    * `permittivity_1D_Maxwellian`
