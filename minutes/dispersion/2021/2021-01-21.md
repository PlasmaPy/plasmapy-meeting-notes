## Attendees

* Erik
* Ramiz
* Nick
* Ben
* Tulasi

## Action Items

***Continuation Items***
> ***Erik***
> * do another review of PR 932
> * update and push changes to notebook associated w/ PR 932
> * open & merge PR for patch of `mass_density` and `Alfven_speed`
> 
> ***Ramiz***
> * will create `plasmapy/dispersion/analytical/` in followup PR to PR 932
> * will open an Issue outlining the two fluid analytical solutions he's working on for PR 932 and the followup PRs
> 
> ***Ramiz & Erik***
> * will think new name for `two_fluid_dispersion_soluntion()` in PR 932 (possibly `two_fluid_bellan_solution()`).

***Ramiz***
* Open next dispersion PR, which should include
    * One more analytical soln
    * Create `plasmapy.dispersion.analytical`

## Minutes

* **MEETINGS FROM NOW ON WILL STILL BE THURSDAY BUT CALLED FOR A WEEK PRIOR**
* **PR 932 is merged!!!**
* Next Dispersion PR(s)
    * 1st PR
        * Create `plasmapy.dispersion.analytical`
        * Move `plasmapy/disperison/two_fluid_dispersion.py` into the analytical sub-package
    * 2nd PR
        * Add next analytical branch to `plasmapy.dispersion.analytical`
        * Rename `plasmapy.dispersion.two_fluid_dispersion_solution` -> `plasmapy.dispersion.two_fluid_bellan_soln`
    * 3rd PR
        * Create factory function `two_fluid_solution()` (specific name can be chosen later)
        * `two_fluid_solution()` should be defined in `plasmapy/dispersion/analytical/` and accessible via `plasmapy.dispersion`
    * Add next analytical solution (which is a Branch of the Bellan soln)
    * Create a factory function for the branches but not in this PR
* Time frame...thesis will consume most of Ramiz's time and this should be only a sanity break
* ...
