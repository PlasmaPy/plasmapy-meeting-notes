## Action Items

***Last Meeting***
> ***Dominik***
> * in PR 953 give reference to Boris pusher blog and then open issue about making our own notebook
> * will ask `xarray` & Astropy about status of unit support...will AstorPy units come in
> 
> ***Erik***
> * communicate to Peter that we should not worry about wrangling units and only add the unit type to `xarray`'s `attrs` field
> 
> ***Peter***
> * Make simple notebooks for the grids (both regular and irregular grids)
> * Open PR for a prototype of fields functionality

***Peter***
* Update `grid.__repr__` to display info also displayed by `xarray.dataset.__repr__`
* read through PR 963 notebooks

***Erik***
* Review PR 963 ... mostly the notebooks
* Check with Nick about reviewing PR 953

## Minutes

* [PR 963](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/963): Grids #2
    * `__repr__`
        * ```python
          def __repr__(self):
              # build out grid repr info
              grid_repr = "..."
              return self.ds.__repr__ + "\n\n" + grid_repr
          ```
        * [Erik] come around to not forcing `grid.__repr__ == dataset.__repr__`.  However, `grid.__repr__` needs to be updated to include info displayed by `dataset.__repr__` (e.g. Variable and Coordinate references)
    * For now, envision a new grid object for each new grid (i.e. not managing data all in one `xarray.dataset`)...**It's not apparent this is not he correct way, but will likely have to be born out of the prototyping.**
* PR 953 looks to be ready for final review
    * Peter will modify proton functionality w.r.t. how the Particle Tracker functionality works ... (i.e. he's waiting of PR 953)
    * After PR 953 is merged, Peter will open a new PR(s) for ParticleTracker that will suggest features need for line integrated diagnostics
