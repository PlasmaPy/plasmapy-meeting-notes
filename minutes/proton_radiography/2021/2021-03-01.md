## Attendees

* Erik
* Peter

## Action Items

***Erik***
* Look into error estimate functionality for Thomson Spectra
* See where LaPD is at with integrating Thomson scattering
* Make a decision on if we should merge Thomson Spectra w/o (or before nailing) the error estimate functionality

## Minutes

* Grids 3...persistent interpolators
* Grids 4...review and minor fixes/refactors
* PR 1049 mesh grids
    * transfers the shadow of a wire mesh to the detector plane
    * current approach
        * mesh is place before the experimental volume
        * protons are considered free streaming to the mesh and those that impact the mesh are removed before the sim starts
        * A warning should be raised if the mesh is placed withing the front edge of the experimental volume, otherwise an exception should be raised
    * currently the mesh is added after the creation of the protons, but this will be refactored to be apart of the initialization before the creation of protons
    * done just needs review
    * hoping to get in the v0.6.0 release
* relativistic boris pusher will test against a relativistic ExB drift
* Fitting Thomson Spectra
    * works pretty well
    * model to use with LMFIT
    * functionality is currently slow (not parallelized)
        * lack of parallelization is due to pickling (of `Particle` class and functionality)
        * PR could be merged now and the the parallelization will be available one the pickling is fix, since the prallelization is built into the LMFIT functionality
    * 2nd part to functionality...error estimates & goodness of fit
        * Need to really review and come to some confidence with the error estimate calculation
        * method is currently discussed in the [PR's notebook](https://plasmapy--974.org.readthedocs.build/en/974/notebooks/thomson_fitting.html)
